    "Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\\\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\\\ inside a regular Python string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings. However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match an Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing '\\' and 'n', while \"\\n\" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.\n",

    "Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if A and B are both regular expressions, then AB is also a regular expression. In general, if a string p matches A and another string q matches B, the string pq will match AB. This holds unless A or B contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between A and B; or have numbered group references. Thus, complex expressions can easily be constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the ones described here.
