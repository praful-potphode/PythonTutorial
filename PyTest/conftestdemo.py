# Run the tests by executing the following command âˆ’
#
# pytest -k divisible -v
# The tests will look for fixture in the same file. As the fixture is not found in the file, it will check for fixture in
# conftest.py file. On finding it, the fixture method is invoked and the result is returned to the input argument of the
# test.
# pytest -k divisible -v conftestdemo.py
