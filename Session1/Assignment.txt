Python Program to Read Print Prime Numbers in a Range using Sieve of Eratosthenes
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:
   --Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
   --Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.
   --Enumerate the multiples of p by counting in increments of p from 2p to n, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...;   the    p itself should not be marked).
   --Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this    new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
   --When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
