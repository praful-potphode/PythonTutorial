# TestCase Class
# Object of this class represents the smallest testable unit. It holds the test routines and provides hooks for preparing
# each routine and for cleaning up thereafter.
# The following methods are defined in the TestCase class âˆ’
# 1.setUp()
# Method called to prepare the test fixture. This is called immediately before calling the test method
#
# 2.tearDown()
# Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the result recorded. This is called even if the test method raised an exception,
#
# 3.setUpClass()
# A class method called before tests in an individual class run.
#
# 4.tearDownClass()
# A class method called after tests in an individual class have run.
#
# 5.run(result=None)
# Run the test, collecting the result into the test result object passed as result.
#
# 6.skipTest(reason)
# Calling this during a test method or setUp() skips the current test.
#
# 7.debug()
# Run the test without collecting the result.

# 8. shortDescription()
# Returns a one-line description of the test.

# Fixtures
# There can be numerous tests written inside a TestCase class. These test methods may need database connection, temporary
# files or other resources to be initialized. These are called fixtures. TestCase includes a special hook to configure and
# clean up any fixtures needed by your tests. To configure the fixtures, override setUp(). To clean up, override tearDown().
# In the following example, two tests are written inside the TestCase class. They test result of addition and subtraction
# of two values. The setup() method initializes the arguments based on shortDescription() of each test. teardown() method
# will be executed at the end of each test.
