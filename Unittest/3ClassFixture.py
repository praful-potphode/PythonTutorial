# TestCase class has a setUpClass() method which can be overridden to execute before the execution of individual tests
# inside a TestCase class. Similarly, tearDownClass() method will be executed after all test in the class. Both the
# methods are class methods. Hence, they must be decorated with @classmethod directive.
# The following example demonstrates the use of these class methods âˆ’
