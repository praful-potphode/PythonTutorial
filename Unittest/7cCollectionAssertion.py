# This set of assert functions are meant to be used with collection data types in Python, such as List, Tuple, Dictionary and Set.
# 1 assertListEqual (list1, list2, msg = None)
# Tests that two lists are equal. If not, an error message is constructed that shows only the differences between the two.
#
# 2 assertTupleEqual (tuple1, tuple2, msg = None)
# Tests that two tuples are equal. If not, an error message is constructed that shows only the differences between the two.
#
# 3 assertSetEqual (set1, set2, msg = None)
# Tests that two sets are equal. If not, an error message is constructed that lists the differences between the sets.
#
# 4 assertDictEqual (expected, actual, msg = None)
# Test that two dictionaries are equal. If not, an error message is constructed that shows the differences in the dictionaries.
#
# The following example implements the above methods âˆ’
