    "### When to use each method type?\n",
    "It may seem tough and daunting decision choosing between the types of methods in Python, but will get the hang of it with a bit of practice.\n",
    "We generally use the class methods to create factory methods which returns the class object for a different use case. As above, classmethod from_birth_year is used to create a class object from a birth year instead of age.\n",
    "Static methods however are primarily used to create utility function and work on data provided to them in arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to remember\n",
    "Instance methods can access the instance through self as well as the class via self.__class__ attribute.\n",
    "Class methods can’t access the instance (self) but they have access to the class itself via cls.\n",
    "Static Methods work like regular functions but belong to the class’s namespace. Static methods don’t have access to cls or self.\n",
    "Even if we write tiny scripts for fun, learning another OOP feature of Python is a great skill to know, and can help to make your code easier to troubleshoot, and easier to reuse in the future."
